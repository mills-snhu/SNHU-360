Mobile Architect and Programming

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. 
What user needs was this app designed to address?  The Inventory app was designed for a user need to store, in a database, a user's  invetory. The app allows the user to add, delete, and modify inventory items as well as update the quntities of each product. The app allowed users to receive text messeges when quantiy of a product was low or zero. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? 
The app needed a login screen for only authorized access, a screen to display all of the product data, and a screen for each individual product with product information. 

How did your UI designs keep users in mind? 
The UI was simple as to not clutter the screen with unnecessary or overwhelming images or add-ons. The color scheme was blue and white with black or white text so users could plainly see each section of text. Each button was clearly marked to let the user know exactly where that button or link will lead

The color scheme and simlplicity

By taking care in applying small amounts of code and reviewing before moving on to the next section of code.

The use of an emulator allowed me to see how the code functioned 

Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
This alloed me to test small sections of text at a time to find any errors easily. 

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
The first time using Android Studio so a qucik learning process was necessary to correctly develope the app

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
Design in the interface came easier as it is similar to the website design process I have done before.
